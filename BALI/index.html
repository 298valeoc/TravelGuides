            <h3>THINGS TO DO IN BALI</h3>
            <p>There are so many places you can’t miss on the Island of the Gods that it’s difficult to choose. To help you out, we’ve written a list of 60 things to do in Bali, Indonesia, so you don’t miss a thing.</p>
            <p>To sum it up, these are the most important attractions to visit during your trip to Bali.</p>
            <p>Best temples in Bali

            <p>Without a doubt, there is nothing like Bali temples, so the first thing you have to do is pinpoint the most important ones.</p>
                
                
            <p>First Bali Travel Tip: Don’t try to visit all the temples
                - Besakih Temple: Mother Temple. The biggest temple in Bali.
                - Ulun Danu Beratan: The most photographed temple in Bali, on Lake Bratan.
                - Pura Luhur Uluwatu: Temple on a cliff. An ideal place to watch the sunset.
                - Tanah Lot: Bali’s most touristy temple, only accessible at low tide.
                - Lempuyang Temple: Temple of the Gates to Heaven.
                There are more than 1,000 temples in Bali, so one of the most well known tips for traveling to Bali is not to get frustrated if you can’t see them all. Even so, I leave you with a slightly more extensive list of temples in Bali that I recommend you visit. </p>
                
                Best rice terraces in Bali
                
                The rice terraces are the best of Bali. Rice is the base ingredient in Balinese cuisine, and as such, rural life revolves around the cultivation of this cereal. If you choose the best time to visit Bali, you’ll be rewarded with green rice paddies and unforgettable landscapes.
                
                Although there are many rice terraces in Bali, these are the best ones:
                
                
                Bali Travel Guide (Indonesia): Visiting the Tegalalang is one of the main things to do in Bali
                - Tegalalang: The most popular rice paddies in Bali.
                - Jatiluwih: Considered a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.
                Best villages in Bali
                
                The traditional villages are something you must visit in Bali because they are full of art and good vibes. While there, you’ll have the perfect opportunity to learn more about Balinese culture and traditions.
                
                
                
                Ubud market, a must-visit in Bali
                - Ubud: Bali artistic and cultural center. Check our complete list of things to do in Ubud.

                - Canggu: Coastal town very popular for its perfect waves for surfing.
                Best beaches in Bali
                
                Taking a trip to Southeast Asia and not planning some time at the beach is a sin. Most of Bali’s best beaches aren’t found on the main island, but rather, on the small islands surrounding Bali. These are the beaches that you should not miss.
                
                
                Kelingking Beach: don’t miss it on your trip to Bali
                - Kelingking Beach: You’ll find some of the best beaches in Bali on the Nusa Islands.
                - Balagan Beach: One of the many turquoise beaches in the Uluwatu area.
                - Jimbaran Beach: The best beach to eat fresh fish with incredible views.
                - Pasut Beach: Black sand beach where you will find a famous crooked palm tree.
                - Kuta: Popular surfing beach among Australian tourists. Party destination.
                - Seminyak: Very popular at sunset, with beautiful beach clubs.
                Best volcanoes in Bali
                
                Bali is a volcanic island that has a lot of activity. Additionally, the volcanoes of Bali are not just part of the landscape. The religion, customs, and traditions of the Balinese people are intimately linked with the volcanoes of the island.

                Best waterfalls in Bali
                
                Visiting the waterfalls of Bali is the best way to get out of the stifling heat. You can even take a dip in some of them. Although most are far from the most touristy sites, on this tour you can see three of the most important Bali waterfalls.
                
                
                
                Include at least one waterfall in your Bali itinerary
                - Nung Nung: Bali’s most popular waterfall, which is 230 ft tall.
                - Tukad Cepung: This waterfall is hidden in a cave.
                - Banyumala: It is one of the most beautiful waterfalls in Bali.
                - Tegenungan: The best waterfall to bathe in in Bali.
                Other things to do in Bali
                
                The list is endless! But below you will find the five best things to see in Bali.
